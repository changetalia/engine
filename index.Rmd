title: "Revolutionizing Power: A Leap Forward in Engine Technology"
---

Today, we are extending an opportunity to collaborate on the development of an advanced internal combustion engine, a revolutionary design promising to deliver torque that is tens, if not hundreds, of times higher than that of traditional engines.

For an in-depth understanding of this groundbreaking engine, we invite you to refer to the U.S. Patent Announcement published on July 11, 2023, bearing Patent No. US 11697993 (US Patent Public Search [https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html]). Remarkably, this patent received approval from the US Patent and Trademark Office in a little over three months, underscoring its unique and high potential.

The new design employs existing cylinder components from conventional engines, eliminating the sealing issues often found in many rotary engines, such as the Wankel engine. The reasons behind this design's impressive increase in torque, ranging from tenfold to a thousandfold improvement, include:

1) The number of cylinders in this engine directly correlates with the number of power strokes per shaft rotation, requiring only half the cylinders of traditional engines. For instance, an 8-cylinder model of this new engine achieves eight power strokes per rotation, a feat that would require 16 cylinders in a conventional engine, as a single-cylinder conventional engine only ignites once every two rotations.

2) Unlike conventional engines, where the maximal explosion force is often offset due to the linear alignment between the piston, connecting rod, and crankshaft, this new engine can generate substantial torque immediately, without any interfering offset. This is achieved as the pistons utlize rollers to move downwards along an inclined plane during the explosion, driving the engine as a whole.

3) Moreover, the engine's cylinders can be arranged eccentrically to produce even higher torque through a more efficient transfer of the pistonâ€™s impulse to the corresponding angular momentum.

Another standout characteristic of this new engine is its compact size and lightweight construction. Given its thicker shaft compared to conventional engines, this design leads to smoother operations that significantly surpass those of conventional crankshaft engines.

With these unique features, it's anticipated that the torque produced by this new engine will greatly outperform conventional engines. If integrated with a power generation system, this engine could become the heart of high-powered electrical devices, opening up limitless applications across various industries. This is particularly true in defense and military sectors where high-power output is crucial, such as in laser weaponry or the design of next-generation military drones.

Through early development of this engine, we have an opportunity to significantly enhance our national strength and competitiveness. However, should our competitors gain an advantage in developing this engine, it could pose a substantial threat to our allies.


If this opportunity resonates with your esteemed company's strategic goals, we, as the inventor, are eager to engage in further discussions and explore potential collaboration.

Thank you for considering this proposition. We look forward to our potential dialogue.
